            <h3>Basics of Tic Tac Toe</h3>
            <p>
                Tic Tac Toe is a game that takes place on a 3x3 grid. 
                Two players take turns marking X and O on the grid until
                 one player gets three in a row. The three in a row can 
                 be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. If all nine squares
                  are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
